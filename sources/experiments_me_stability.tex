Gain access to the exact same sequences used by Steve for his previous paper. 
Run the 3D motion estimation / monocular SLAM system (when ready) on these sequences, using your proposed methods. 
Superimpose results on the same plot as used in the previous paper, to show that error has been much improved.

Mean time until failure can be defined as the metric.
