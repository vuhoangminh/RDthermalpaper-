%This is where you will assess the effectiveness of different thresholds and/or settings for the edge detection, and also establish which (if any) of your proposed filters and other methods actually improve performance, and how fast they are.




In this section, the effectiveness 



authors would like to establish the effectiveness of the two proposed denoising methods, namely Non-local algorithm \cite{Buades} and Transform-domain collaborative filtering \cite{dabov2007image}. In short, first method analyzes noise for  local smoothing filters followed by computing nonlocal means whilst second approach groups 2D image fragments into 3D data arrays to unveil the finest details based on aggregation and collaborative Wiener filtering.
